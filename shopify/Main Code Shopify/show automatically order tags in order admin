Just to confirm, yes, the workflows you create in Shopify Flow will work for all orders as long as the conditions you set are met. There is no specific limit on the number of times an order can be placed that would affect the functionality of your workflows. Each time an order is created, the workflow will trigger based on the defined conditions and actions you have set up. This means that if your workflow is designed to tag orders upon creation, it will do so for every order that meets the criteria you specified, regardless of how many times an order is placed by a customer. You can also create workflows that apply to all products and all orders without restrictions, as long as they align with the triggers and conditions you have established in your Flow app




**Example Workflow:**
1. **Trigger**: When an order is placed.
2. **Condition**: Check if the item is available in the warehouse.
3. **Action**: If the item is not available in the warehouse but is available in the storefront, automatically transfer the inventory from the storefront to the warehouse.
4. **Notification**: Send a notification to your staff to physically move the item from the storefront to the warehouse.
This workflow will help ensure that your online orders are fulfilled without causing discrepancies in your inventory.




Which one it is between the 2 options?
As we provide limited assistance with the creation of custom Flows, but you can rely on the Flow library to copy a template for there.

I can see there are a few options to update products when they are out stock as you can see here you could implement this, while there are no options for a Flow that automatically updates inventory. 

If you want to create a custom Flow that manages the whole inventory you can either hire a developer that can set this up for you, or post this question on our Shopify Community where developers are always willing to help, they may suggest you the correct triggers and the set up of the Flow
