Subject: Leave Application for January 2nd and 3rd  

Respected [Manager/Sir/Madam],**

I kindly request leave on January 2nd and 3rd as I need to attend a significant RSS event in Indore on January 3rd, where the esteemed RSS Chief, Mohan Bhagwat Ji, will be present. A preparatory camp for the same is scheduled from January 1st to 3rd, and I would like to contribute to the preparations as well.  

I assure you that I will complete any pending work before my leave.  

Thank you for considering my request.  

Yours sincerely,
[Your Name]
